Sample characteristics
The sample resembles the UK adult population to some degree. There were slightly more females than males in the sample. The majority of the sample is married (48%) or single (25.3%). Participants had either no educational qualifications (35%), only GSCE/ 0 level education (18%) or higher study, e.g. degree, qualifications (15%). Almost all participants were of White ethnicity (92%), surpassing the 80% proportion of the 2021 Census. Three quarters of the sample did not engage in smoking behaviours, making the sample quite unbalanced in this way. The sample collected exhibits similarities to the UK adult population, providing valuable insights into the demographics. The gender distribution shows a slightly higher representation of females compared to males, indicating a modest gender imbalance. Regarding marital status, the majority of participants identified as married (48%), followed by those who reported being single (25.3%). In terms of educational qualifications, a notable portion of the sample (35%) had no formal qualifications, while 18% possessed GSCE/0 level education, and 15% had higher qualifications such as degrees. The ethnic composition of the sample was predominantly White (92%), surpassing the 80% reported in the 2021 Census. Notably, the smoking behavior distribution within the sample revealed a significant imbalance, with approximately three-quarters of participants reporting non-smoking habits. These insights highlight the importance of considering the sample's composition when interpreting findings related to smoking behaviors.
